We achieve this in multiple ways: Teaching : It is our duty to ensure that the students we graduate possess the skills and knowledge to contribute positively to society. In South Africa specifically, this extends to addressing the historical inequities by actively representing underrepresented groups and empowering the next generation to dream bigger and aim higher. Education is a critical tool in creating a more equitable society. Industry Collaboration : The application of our academic skills in industry is paramount. By maintaining open communication and collaboration with industry, we align our research and teaching with the current and future needs of the economy. This keeps our work relevant and ensures that the insights from academia flow directly into practical, economic advancements. Forward-Looking Research : Our research must not only address current problems but also anticipate future challenges. We have a responsibility to think ahead, tackling the problems of tomorrow through innovative and cutting-edge research. This proactive approach strengthens the foundation for sustainable development and progress. Research areas Virtual Prototyping of Manufacturing Assembly Systems Manufacturing assembly is a major generator of economic wealth, and human operators remain a crucial component of manufacturing systems. While Industry 4.0 was techno-centric, Industry 5.0 brings with it a redefined value system that is human-centric, with an emphasis on making technologies practical and applicable. In this line of research, we focus on applying bleeding-edge tools to create systems that support resilient manufacturing assembly, strengthening South Africa's atrophying manufacturing industry. Through virtual prototyping, we can develop tools appropriate for small-scale manufacturing, enabling SMEs to respond quickly to market changes and exploit modern tools and technologies in ways that larger businesses cannot. Virtual Reality Engineering Training and Education The demand for engineering training is scaling rapidly. Class sizes are increasing, and technology-driven disruptions will result in large-scale (re)training. Scaling engineering experience has become an urgent priority. From an engineering education perspective, virtual reality makes it possible to provide industry-like experiences when physical site visits are impractical or unsafe, while still allowing visceral and practical (pre)experiences. Gamification has been shown to improve knowledge retention in both staff and students, but it requires significant development time. Disruptions such as the transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles mean that large numbers of maintenance employees will need retraining. By developing virtual training and educational experiences, we can enable greater engagement with cutting-edge technologies that would otherwise be too expensive to experience at scale. The African Infrastructure Transition Africa is characterized by a large rural population that is sparsely distributed. This situation demands a re-examination of common infrastructure assumptions. Aging and expensive infrastructure, designed for centralized and globally integrated cultures, is often poorly suited to African contexts. The question here is simple: should we not consider African-centric solutions, thereby leapfrogging much of the proposed infrastructural change? A few examples come to mind. If you had the choice, would you not prefer to cook by fire? This line of investigation examines solutions to current problems in ways that respect local cultures and the people affected by them. \u201cIt is important to remember that technology should serve people, and not the other way around.\u201d My research ambitions can be divided into three key areas: technical , capacity-building , and social . Technical (Digital Twin) My primary technical interest lies in the concept of the digital twin. Specifically, I am exploring how virtual tools can be used during the early and mid-stages of system design. The central question here is: How far can we progress in designing intelligent systems using virtual tools before we purchase physical equipment and commit to specific vendors? Capacity-Building and Teaching (Undergraduate Research) My focus here is on undergraduate research (UGR). Given the current academic context\u2014larger classes, DHET funding tied to research outputs and publications, and a relatively young engineering faculty\u2014UGR can be highly beneficial. I aim to implement UGR strategies that have proven successful elsewhere. The question I pose is: Should we not introduce research activities earlier in our academic careers? Social (Just Energy Transition) My social interest focuses on the just energy transition. While many benefit from the growing maturity of renewable energy technologies, certain groups remain excluded. In South Africa, for example, there are micro-communities with low populations, isolated locations, and limited economic resources. These factors often disincentivize infrastructure development. However, their modest needs and isolated nature could make them ideal beneficiaries of renewable energy. This raises the question: Should we not rethink African infrastructure given our sparsely populated continent? While responsible use of funds is a fundamental principle, I believe these specific interventions will enhance the societal impact of our work, making our contributions as researchers even more valuable to South Africa's economic and social progress.","title":"Researchers creed"},{"location":"researchers%20creed/#research-areas","text":"","title":"Research areas"},{"location":"researchers%20creed/#virtual-prototyping-of-manufacturing-assembly-systems","text":"Manufacturing assembly is a major generator of economic wealth, and human operators remain a crucial component of manufacturing systems.

To provide structure, this manual introduces the gap analysis approach, which transforms the literature review into a systematic process. By conducting a gap analysis, you create a tangible output: a gap analysis table. This table visually captures the current state of the field (state of the art) and identifies areas for further research. It also helps guide your project development, especially in fields like engineering where creating practical outcomes is essential. What Is a Gap Analysis Table? A gap analysis table organizes and summarizes existing work to highlight what has been done and what remains to be addressed. It uses two key dimensions: Vertical Axis (Left Column): Represents the body of related work. This could include frameworks, methods, or studies that address similar problems to your project. Examples: Research papers, frameworks, models, or industrial applications. Horizontal Axis (Top Row): Represents the features or factors under investigation. These can take different forms: Binary (e.g., \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d to indicate whether a feature is addressed). Categorical (e.g., specific domains like Manufacturing, Mining, or Healthcare). Numerical Range (e.g., operating temperature ranges such as \u201c100-300\u00b0C\u201d). Steps to Create a Gap Analysis Table Identify Related Work: Collect studies, frameworks, or solutions related to your research area. List these along the vertical axis. Determine Features or Factors: Decide on the key features or factors relevant to your project. These will form the horizontal axis. Populate the Table: For each related work, assess whether it addresses the features or factors. Use binary indicators (e.g., Yes/No), categorical labels, or numerical ranges as appropriate. Analyse the Table: Highlight gaps by identifying features or factors not covered in existing work. Use this analysis to refine your research focus, ensuring your project adds value by addressing these gaps.

Generally the artefact is a solution to a problem, can also be argued as an academic publication. It vaguely resembles the methods of complex systems simulation white boxing models to investigate emergent behaviour [Stephan wolfram]. While different processes of the design-science exist [ 6-step , Three-cycle , general-and-concrete-solution , FEDS , HENSOLT ]. These appear to be variants describing three distinct characteristics.

In our investigation we take a general systems approach where \"a law must be demonstrated on at least two independent systems\" [Weinberg]. Therefore, we demonstrate our idea through two independent problems, the develop human-centric assembly stations using virutal reality. These chapters follow the following logic. We begin with relevance, identifying the needs of future systems based on literature. These include (1) investigations affecting the adoption and adaption of systems to human-centricity [Leitao], (2) economic agenda's describing future needs like in Industry 5.0 and EU-SGDs, and (3) perspectives interpreting these future needs [Lithui]. Synthesizing the requirements from literature leads to perspective on what human-centric solutions look like. The problems selected are inspired by recent research and involve currently maturing technologies (deep learning and Additive manufacturing) in order to illustrate the novelty of this work. These insure a higher chance of novelty/uniqueness. We do not consider rigor or improvement. While we are convinced that using other algorithms will improve the performance of these systems it is outside the scope of this work. We do acknowledge the ability to improve performance through systematically separating components, prioritizing virtual design iteration. Investigation structure Chapter 5 demonstrates how virtual assembly stations can be used for design for assembly. It specifically addresses the numerous design for assembly possibilities presented by additive manufacturing in the form of SLM printing and how virtual assembly can be used to compare and rank design alternatives based on assembly time and assembly error. From this demonstration it became clear that the cost of the human labour int human-in-the-loop simulations are significant and this type of simulation can benefit from reducing the number of samples. Chapter 4 then addresses this issue by investigating sample efficient methods. When predicting the assembly time this method reduces the amount of simulation samples by using a surrogate model. While the initial goal was sample efficiency, the finding concluded that these simulations can scale to provide large data sets. This can be achieved by combining the proposed method will developments in academic literature and industry, resulting in remote, concurrent, sample efficient simulations. Chapter 3 builds on these novel implementations as demonstrations. It illustrates the general human performance data in the form of assembly quality, time, and error can be measured from the virtual workstations. It validates the measurements against well established models and illustrates that novel insights can be achieved by enriching existing models. This again illustrates using the design science approach of gaining knowledge based on artefacts and insights gained from prior artefacts. Chapter 2 then provides a vocabulary for implementing human-centric data-driven systems as a conjecture. It can be applied more generally but acknowledges the cost of human labour in these simulations as an ethical constraint. Chapter 6 reflects the implementations (3,4,5) through the lens initially proposed (2), bringing to conclusion the investigation (7). It should be noted that the investigation sequence did not follow the publication sequence as confidence in the simulation results was a required before making system statements. For example, the investigation in chapter 3 was done prior to demonstrations (4 and 5), but demonstrations were published first as they increased confidence in the developed system and by extension methodology.","title":"Thesis structure"},{"location":"Blog/thesis%20structure/#thesis-structure","text":"Implementing human-centric systems are difficult to quantify.

We begin with relevance, identifying the needs of future systems based on literature. These include (1) investigations affecting the adoption and adaption of systems to human-centricity [Leitao], (2) economic agenda's describing future needs like in Industry 5.0 and EU-SGDs, and (3) perspectives interpreting these future needs [Lithui]. Synthesizing the requirements from literature leads to perspective on what human-centric solutions look like. The problems selected are inspired by recent research and involve currently maturing technologies (deep learning and Additive manufacturing) in order to illustrate the novelty of this work. These insure a higher chance of novelty/uniqueness. We do not consider rigor or improvement. While we are convinced that using other algorithms will improve the performance of these systems it is outside the scope of this work. We do acknowledge the ability to improve performance through systematically separating components, prioritizing virtual design iteration.","title":"Design science methodology"},{"location":"Blog/thesis%20structure/#investigation-structure","text":"Chapter 5 demonstrates how virtual assembly stations can be used for design for assembly. It specifically addresses the numerous design for assembly possibilities presented by additive manufacturing in the form of SLM printing and how virtual assembly can be used to compare and rank design alternatives based on assembly time and assembly error. From this demonstration it became clear that the cost of the human labour int human-in-the-loop simulations are significant and this type of simulation can benefit from reducing the number of samples. Chapter 4 then addresses this issue by investigating sample efficient methods. When predicting the assembly time this method reduces the amount of simulation samples by using a surrogate model. While the initial goal was sample efficiency, the finding concluded that these simulations can scale to provide large data sets. This can be achieved by combining the proposed method will developments in academic literature and industry, resulting in remote, concurrent, sample efficient simulations. Chapter 3 builds on these novel implementations as demonstrations. It illustrates the general human performance data in the form of assembly quality, time, and error can be measured from the virtual workstations. It validates the measurements against well established models and illustrates that novel insights can be achieved by enriching existing models. This again illustrates using the design science approach of gaining knowledge based on artefacts and insights gained from prior artefacts. Chapter 2 then provides a vocabulary for implementing human-centric data-driven systems as a conjecture. It can be applied more generally but acknowledges the cost of human labour in these simulations as an ethical constraint. Chapter 6 reflects the implementations (3,4,5) through the lens initially proposed (2), bringing to conclusion the investigation (7). It should be noted that the investigation sequence did not follow the publication sequence as confidence in the simulation results was a required before making system statements. For example, the investigation in chapter 3 was done prior to demonstrations (4 and 5), but demonstrations were published first as they increased confidence in the developed system and by extension methodology.","title":"Investigation structure"},{"location":"Blog/thesis-abstract/","text":"Abstract Despite recent advances in disruptive technologies like automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality, humans remain a precious resource for manufacturing assembly. Paradigms such as Industry 4.0, IoT, digital twin, and cyber-physical systems emphasize the convergence of connectivity, integration, high-fidelity simulation, and heterarchical systems architectures to develop complex integrated systems. More recently, Industry 5.0 places the human operator at the center of system design, but due to human-machine interfaces, developing such systems is challenging. The introductory chapters describe the changing role of the operator in manufacturing and motivate the development of human-centric solutions. This thesis investigates the development of human-centric systems by leveraging virtual reality for digital workstation prototyping. To this end, the first core chapter reports a study confirming that a virtual workstation can measure data crucial to manufacturing assembly, specifically, the throughput rate, risk of defective assemblies, and assembly errors. This study aims to increase confidence in data acquired from the simulation and serves to convince skeptics. After confirming that we can acquire meaningful data, the second study applies this technique to a decision framework for suggesting the best manufacturing design. This illustrates the usefulness of this technique in digital prototyping and product design. The results also illustrate that this technique can be used to plan workstation and factory layouts to meet production requirements. The prior two studies revealed that human trials are costly and time-inefficient, as experiment designers often acquire ample data. The third study addresses this issue by developing a data-efficient experimental framework. This framework uses an active machine learning model that adapts the design experiments online. This illustrates that VR simulation can include an intelligent system and move from a passive framework for acquiring data to an intelligent one with adaptive control. A deeper inspection revealed that the active model can be used for sample-efficient modeling and control simultaneously. This presents an ethical issue as controlling human systems removes the operator's free will. The next two chapters investigate a method of controlling human systems based on extracting the human internal state. Such a system would optimize for production but also for the operator's health. To investigate using the active model for control, a fourth study applies this technique to the control of non-human systems, showing it can be extended with application-specific constraints. In conclusion, the framework for developing human assembly systems using virtual reality reduces capital and technical investment risk. Confirmation of measurement via simulation, application of data acquisition, and data-based control applications appear as logical steps. Control of human systems presents some ethical challenges, and we suggest a theoretical approach. The methods described herein will facilitate the development of modern human manufacturing systems by providing a framework that can be applied to the development of new systems and the retrofitting of existing ones. This work is also valid for other physical fields like medicine, mining, and engineering.","title":"Abstract"},{"location":"Blog/thesis-abstract/#abstract","text":"Despite recent advances in disruptive technologies like automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality, humans remain a precious resource for manufacturing assembly.

This is largely due to challenges in measuring and modeling. Measuring Challenges Humans are significantly more difficult to measure than their machine counterparts. Firstly, because machines operate longer hours. We can easily have machine operators for 20 or more hour shifts, whereas doing the same for a human is simply unethical. These longer operating hours mean we can gather more data from machines over longer windows of time. The second challenge is the effect of measuring. While retrofitting a machine with additional sensors presents no challenges, the same cannot be said for humans. Measuring operator's state, performance, and activities are invasive. While this may seem like a small issue that can be overcome with time, higher levels of stress are associated with a greater risk of injury and lower performance levels[]. This poses the direct problem that measuring adversely affects the performance of operators, not revealing their true performance. In the case of wearable gloves and sensor-based instrumentation and tools, the cause is not psychological but physical. These gloves, tools, etc., directly interfere with the operator's agency, comfort, task familiarity, and ability to perform the given task. In the end, the act of measuring human operators can inhibit their performance, leading to biased data. The third issue of ethical use of data is of growing concern. In general, there have been numerous scandals involving mega-corporations like Google, Facebook, and Amazon regarding the abuse of general users' data [ Cambridge analytica ]. While Europe has regulated the storage location and uses of citizen data [ GDPR ], they have also begun looking at the ethical use of data in the workforce [ 1 ], quoting the right to privacy [ Article 8 ]. Regulations inhibit the sharing of data between business entities and limit the application of data for hiring based on performance. It becomes clear that we cannot blindly apply the techniques used to measure machines to measuring humans. We need to be careful, as the operator's impression is likely to affect the adoption of this technology. Public perception will also affect adoption and application, as we must be careful to remember that systems serve humans [IEEE message], and Asimov's laws of robotics must be adhered to in order not to raise the public's anxiety to stories like Terminator, The Matrix, and iRobot. Modelling Challenges Another, not totally independent issue, is the challenge of modeling human behaviour and performance. Humans are inherently complex to model, and more complex models require more data, recursively indicating the feedback loop of challenges between human data and practical application. The complexity of human models is caused by a few characteristics best juxtaposed with their machine counterparts. Firstly, humans exhibit dynamic behaviour that can change rapidly over time due to states like learning and fatigue. Machine models, on the other hand, tend to operate under predefined rules and exhibit steady-state behaviour. This becomes obvious when we compare a 12-hour shift of industrial robot assembly with that of manual assembly. Human operators' performance is likely to suffer from reduced throughput and increased errors, while machine performance remains unchanged. Modelling the dynamic behaviour of humans is challenging and often requires real-time data. Revealing the second issue, that human internal states like learning and fatigue are not directly measurable. This leads to estimation and observation of ill-defined quantities that can only be relatively defined. There is no absolute measure for fatigue and learning, making models relevant only within a small domain (limited transference). Repeatability in measurements are also an issue influenced by long-term learning, interindividual variability, and biological factors. These issues are suggestive of a probablistic model instead of a deterministic one, again make modelling challenging and may require additional data. Human states can interact, leading to complex behaviour. For example, a fatigued operator will learn slower. Similarly, a well-learned operator will accumulate less fatigue from a task. Summary The challenges associated with measuring and modelling human operators compound each other. While the cost associated with acquiring data is high due to sensors inhibiting operator performance, the amount of data acquired is significantly lower due to to the limited workhours of human operators. To compound this human models are significantly more complex due to their dynamic, probabilistic, interacting, and indirectly measurable state. These complex models require more data. The models are also only valid within a small domain, limiting the resuse of data. Applying the technologies developed for machines to humans is insufficient to meet the challenges. The data acquisition, data usage, and models need to be closely examined to ensure they meet the ethical requirement of \"serving humans.\" For example, invasive and inhibiting sensors, data used for performance and disciplinary action, and unempathetic operator models are just a few of the issues that arise when applying existing machine-based approaches to human operators. It is my view that acknowledging the complexity of the task at hand will yield more creative solutions.","title":"Measuring humans"},{"location":"Blog/Human%20centric%20design%20framework/measuring-humans/#measuring-challenges","text":"Humans are significantly more difficult to measure than their machine counterparts.

These students already know how to read a textbook. From this perspective, my role is not merely to summarize content, but to help them realize projects that can benefit society. The growing class sizes (120+ seniors) and pandemic push towards remote learning appear to have reduced student engagement and attendance. This creates a challenge in balancing autonomy and engagement. On the other hand, the challenge we face is that students enter our program with varying backgrounds and levels of experience. For instance, some students might have a strong foundation in computer programming from high school, while others may have only used email before starting university. Similarly, one student may own a virtual reality headset, whereas another might not even have a laptop. These diverse range of backgrounds create a challenge for starting points to learning, especiallly in education in a technology dependant doman like engineering. This diversity necessitates a curriculum that is inclusive, engaging, and constructive, catering to a wide range of social and experiential backgrounds. As we strive to develop well-rounded, resilient, and impactful graduates, we adhere to the graduate attributes (GA's) outlined by Stellenbosch University 1 and the Engineering Council of South Africa 2 . These GA's incorporate high level characteristics previously considered as hard and soft skills. These GA's provide a valuable vision for what the next generation of graduation should look like. What is important to remeber is that assessement of GA's does not scale well with class sizes. For students from less privileged backgrounds, the goal is to provide exposure to modern engineering tools and technologies, helping to level the playing field. For students with more resources, the emphasis is on understanding and communicating high-level concepts, regardless of the specific technology involved. This approach fosters a deeper grasp of core ideas and enhances their ability to convey complex concepts effectively. I actively integrate discussions on societal trends, such as sustainable development goals, into the curriculum, highlighting how current technologies can address these issues locally. Personal reflection From a young age, I was captivated by the natural world. Watching Sunday night documentaries and observing ants in the garden, I was fascinated by the stories of great scientists and their discoveries. I still marvel at the wonders of astronomy and how we imagine the cosmos in all its splendor. Video games also shaped my thinking, focusing on problem-solving and simulations of complex systems. I found comfort in unraveling puzzles and exploring unknown scenarios, which deepened my curiosity and passion for discovery. Despite my early fascination, my path to academia was not straightforward. Discouraged from taking higher-level courses in high school, I didn\u2019t initially apply to university, even though I excelled in mathematics. I spent two years at a technical university before transferring to a classical one. This detour taught me invaluable lessons: to question everything, trust my instincts, and understand that no system is perfect. These experiences have made me especially empathetic toward students who don\u2019t fit the traditional academic mold or take unconventional paths. Life is challenging, but pursuing science is worth the struggle. As an academic researcher, I am privileged to explore topics I am passionate about, funded by taxpayers, with the hope of making the world a better place. This career has given me the freedom to indulge in my curiosity, financial stability, and the fulfilment of a lifelong dream. However, I never felt truly validated until I could help others experience the same joy and curiosity. I see every student as a young researcher fueled by intrigue, even though I am often reminded of their focus on academic scores. This drives my commitment to making students feel welcome, competent, and confident in their academic journeys. I want them to experience the playful curiosity and endless opportunities that scientific inquiry offers. Academia has given me a strong sense of purpose and the chance to inspire the next generation of scientists. I am deeply grateful for the opportunities it has afforded me and am passionate about helping students navigate their own paths, no matter how unconventional they may be. Teaching philosophy The societal implications of projects, people, and organizations are the ultimate purpose of all academic pursuits. Contributions at both professional and academic levels improve society, and it is crucial for us to regularly revisit this \u201cwhy\u201d in the classroom. Every graduate I mentor has the potential to improve countless lives, which inspires me to push beyond my own limits. Conversely, students must understand the potential impact of their success. Creating a nurturing environment conducive to success is essential. While good intentions, inspiration, and ambition make for compelling stories, the path to realization is paved with disciplined habits. I support individuals who bravely attempt new challenges, ask questions, and test boundaries. This means fostering an environment where discussion, failure, and diverse opinions are welcomed. After all, universities are meant to be a melting pot of the greatest minds of our generation. \u201cSteel molds steel, so one person molds another.\u201d A model of maturity for individuals within an organisation 3 applied to teaching starts with instructing the students (dependence), having them perform independently (zone of proximal development), and finally having them co-create. Developing individuals who can transform ideas into reality involves a delicate balance of nurturing and empowering, rather than merely instructing. By applying their skills, students grow both confident and competent. My goal is to create environments and opportunities for progressive learning, allowing students to exercise autonomy. \u201cWe grow through people and projects,\u201d and these habits are best cultivated through practice, not lectures. Ultimately, my aim is to develop individuals to a point where they no longer need me and are fully equipped to make their own impact on the world. When I ask a complex, contextual exam question and receive meaningful answers, I know I have made a contribution towards a better society. Professionals Shaping Society Students are the catalysts of societal change. As educators, our role is to equip them with the confidence , conviction , and competence to lead this transformation. Confidence Confidence is nurtured by treating students as emerging professionals. Instead of making them \"earn their place,\" I welcome them into the engineering community through role-playing exercises, where they tackle real-world challenges as consultants. This helps them envision their future roles and builds their self-assurance. Conviction Conviction stems from understanding the broader impact of their work. I emphasize the importance of linking their academic efforts to societal needs, fostering a sense of purpose and commitment to making a difference. Competence Competence cannot be achieved in the classroom alone. It requires continuous learning and self-reflection. Mastery is achieved through deliberate practice, and students must be encouraged to see learning as a lifelong journey. Confidence and competence are built through practice and evidence of improvement. Through amounting evidence, students gain proof of their growing abilities. Conviction in the form of perseverance emerge from recognizing the value they bring to society. Understanding their role in aiding others inspires them to undertake ambitious projects for the greater good, rekindling a selfless pursuit of challenging goals. These three pillars form an intrinsic motivation framework for developing professionals who shape society for the better. Questions that placing students as professionals I use questioning techniques to immerse students in their professional roles 4 , deepening their understanding of ethical and societal responsibilities. When introducing a new concept, I present scenarios that require real-world decision-making. First, I role-play by posing a question as if they were professionals: \"You are consulted on a project and asked to decide whether a SCADA or IoT system is appropriate.\" Next, we explore boundaries through extreme values, such as, \"The system requires high cybersecurity and should not introduce additional risks.\" Finally, students reflect and communicate professionally by justifying their answers to a client. This approach builds confidence and conveniently serves as a method for creating effective exercise questions. Resulting question: You have been consulted on a project to determine whether a SCADA or IoT system is more suitable for a manufacturing control system dealing with highly sensitive products. Given that cybersecurity is of paramount importance, evaluate both options and recommend the most appropriate system. Justify your decision by addressing the client\u2019s specific needs. Play I am inspired by the concept of play as a tool for lifelong learning. \" Interest begat knowledge, not the other way around \". For example, making failure enjoyable motivates learners to keep trying. Play encourages autonomy, a trait often suppressed in traditional education. Vygotsky emphasized plays role in development and self-regulation 5 , while Dewey likened children\u2019s natural experimentation to scientific inquiry 6 . Previously, integrating play into engineering education was limited by rigid curricula. However, the shift towards holistic graduate attributes now supports this approach. Techniques like open canopy learning 7 help students engage with the real world, fostering professional growth and societal impact. For example, ECSA\u2019s GAs require graduates to navigate real-world ethical and complex environments. Methods like open canopy learning, which involves: Observing surroundings closely, Sharing personal stories and perspectives, Making connections with people, concepts, and experiences, Generating and consuming content through thoughtful peer review. This approach helps students see themselves as professionals shaping society, building on the exercise. \"Knowledge is of no value unless put into practice.\" ~ Anton Chekhov The Cognitive, affective, systematic The Cognitive-Affective Systemic (CAS) model was proposed by Alan Tait 8 at the Open university to meet the requirements of remote learning. The CAS Model, integrates cognitive and emotional aspects of learning within a systemic framework for teaching. It emphasizes understanding how students' thoughts, feelings, and environmental contexts interact dynamically to influence learning. This model advocates for personalized, learner-centered approaches, considering the emotional and motivational states of students as essential for effective teaching. It encourages educators to create environments that support cognitive engagement and emotional well-being, ultimately enhancing the learning experience. Personal growth My journey in academic teaching has been profoundly influenced by my commitment to personal growth and development. As a participant in the PREDAC program, I\u2019ve engaged with a community of new academics dedicated to enhancing teaching practices. Publishing three conference papers in engineering education has further deepened my understanding of pedagogical strategies. Additionally, completing a FINLO project has allowed me to explore innovative approaches to learning. Being actively involved in the academic community at Stellenbosch University, I continuously strive to refine my teaching methods and contribute meaningfully to the academic landscape. Conclusion In my teaching and supervision, I strive to foster an environment where students not only acquire knowledge but also develop the confidence, conviction, and competence to apply it meaningfully. By integrating elements of play, professional role-playing, and a deep commitment to personalized learning, I aim to inspire students to see themselves as active contributors to society. My ultimate goal is to nurture lifelong learners and innovative thinkers who are well-equipped to tackle real-world challenges and make a positive impact on their communities and beyond.

These students already know how to read a textbook. From this perspective, my role is not merely to summarize content, but to help them realize projects that can benefit society. The growing class sizes (120+ seniors) and pandemic push towards remote learning appear to have reduced student engagement and attendance. This creates a challenge in balancing autonomy and engagement. On the other hand, the challenge we face is that students enter our program with varying backgrounds and levels of experience. For instance, some students might have a strong foundation in computer programming from high school, while others may have only used email before starting university. Similarly, one student may own a virtual reality headset, whereas another might not even have a laptop. These diverse range of backgrounds create a challenge for starting points to learning, especiallly in education in a technology dependant doman like engineering. This diversity necessitates a curriculum that is inclusive, engaging, and constructive, catering to a wide range of social and experiential backgrounds. As we strive to develop well-rounded, resilient, and impactful graduates, we adhere to the graduate attributes (GA's) outlined by Stellenbosch University 1 and the Engineering Council of South Africa 2 . These GA's incorporate high level characteristics previously considered as hard and soft skills. These GA's provide a valuable vision for what the next generation of graduation should look like. What is important to remeber is that assessement of GA's does not scale well with class sizes. For students from less privileged backgrounds, the goal is to provide exposure to modern engineering tools and technologies, helping to level the playing field. For students with more resources, the emphasis is on understanding and communicating high-level concepts, regardless of the specific technology involved. This approach fosters a deeper grasp of core ideas and enhances their ability to convey complex concepts effectively. I actively integrate discussions on societal trends, such as sustainable development goals, into the curriculum, highlighting how current technologies can address these issues locally.","title":"Context"},{"location":"Teaching/Teaching%20and%20supervision/#personal-reflection","text":"From a young age, I was captivated by the natural world. Watching Sunday night documentaries and observing ants in the garden, I was fascinated by the stories of great scientists and their discoveries. I still marvel at the wonders of astronomy and how we imagine the cosmos in all its splendor. Video games also shaped my thinking, focusing on problem-solving and simulations of complex systems. I found comfort in unraveling puzzles and exploring unknown scenarios, which deepened my curiosity and passion for discovery. Despite my early fascination, my path to academia was not straightforward. Discouraged from taking higher-level courses in high school, I didn\u2019t initially apply to university, even though I excelled in mathematics. I spent two years at a technical university before transferring to a classical one. This detour taught me invaluable lessons: to question everything, trust my instincts, and understand that no system is perfect. These experiences have made me especially empathetic toward students who don\u2019t fit the traditional academic mold or take unconventional paths. Life is challenging, but pursuing science is worth the struggle. As an academic researcher, I am privileged to explore topics I am passionate about, funded by taxpayers, with the hope of making the world a better place. This career has given me the freedom to indulge in my curiosity, financial stability, and the fulfilment of a lifelong dream. However, I never felt truly validated until I could help others experience the same joy and curiosity. I see every student as a young researcher fueled by intrigue, even though I am often reminded of their focus on academic scores.

Purpose: This project aims to develop a VR-based classroom experiment to create supportive learning environments by fostering comfort with technology and assessing affective responses. It also contributes to a framework for sustainably integrating VR into engineering education through in-house development and multi-course employment. Method: Third- and fourth-year engineering students participated in a VR facility layout exercise. Their emotional responses were measured using modified Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) surveys. The study focused on iterating the VR framework rather than immediate scientific inquiries. Findings: Fourth-year students showed more positive and fewer negative emotional responses to VR compared to third-year students, indicating greater familiarity and comfort with the technology. The self-reporting method effectively gauged student comfort levels with VR. Implications: The framework can: - Compare affective responses between academic years. - Evaluate responses to curriculum changes. - Assess comfort levels across different socio-economic groups. Limitations: While affective responses provide insight into the learning environment, they do not measure knowledge acquisition, which requires separate assessment. The relative nature of affective responses limits the value of quantifying a 'ground truth.' Social Impact: The project advances education by integrating VR technology, enhancing technological literacy, and preparing students for a digital future.
