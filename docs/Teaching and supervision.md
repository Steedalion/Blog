## Teaching philosophy

I am fortunate to teach in one of the most challenging programs at one of the top universities in the country. These students already know how to read a textbook. From this perspective, my role is not merely to summarize content, but to enable them to realize projects that can better society.

The societal implications of projects, people, and organizations are the ultimate purpose of all academic pursuits. Contributions at all professional and academic levels improve society. It is crucial for us to regularly revisit this “why” in the classroom. Every graduate I have mentored has the potential to improve countless lives, which inspires me to push beyond my own limits. On the other hand, students must understand the potential impact of their success.

It is crucial to create a nurturing environment conducive to success and guiding individuals toward that success. Good intentions, inspiration, and ambition make for great stories, but the path to realization is paved with disciplined habits. I nurture individuals who bravely attempt new challenges, ask questions, and test boundaries. To me, this means fostering an environment where discussion, failure, and diverse opinions are welcomed. After all, universities are meant to be a melting pot of the greatest minds of our generation.

“Steel molds steel, so one person molds another.”

Developing individuals who can transform an idea into reality is a delicate balance of nurturing and empowering, rather than instructing. Through applying their skills, students grow both confident and competent. My goal is to create environments and opportunities for progressive learning, allowing students to exercise autonomy. “We grow through people and projects,” and these habits are best cultivated through practice, not lectures. Ultimately, my aim is to develop individuals to a point where they no longer need me, fully equipped to make their own impact on the world. When I ask a complex/contextual exam question and receive meaningful answers, I a have made my contribution towards a better society.
