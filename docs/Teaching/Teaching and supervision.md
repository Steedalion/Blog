## Teaching philosophy

I am fortunate to teach in one of the most challenging programs at one of the top universities in the country. These students already know how to read a textbook. From this perspective, my role is not merely to summarize content, but to help them realize projects that can benefit society.

The societal implications of projects, people, and organizations are the ultimate purpose of all academic pursuits. Contributions at both professional and academic levels improve society, and it is crucial for us to regularly revisit this “why” in the classroom. Every graduate I mentor has the potential to improve countless lives, which inspires me to push beyond my own limits. Conversely, students must understand the potential impact of their success.

Creating a nurturing environment conducive to success is essential. While good intentions, inspiration, and ambition make for compelling stories, the path to realization is paved with disciplined habits. I support individuals who bravely attempt new challenges, ask questions, and test boundaries. This means fostering an environment where discussion, failure, and diverse opinions are welcomed. After all, universities are meant to be a melting pot of the greatest minds of our generation.

“Steel molds steel, so one person molds another.”

*A model of maturity for individuals within an organisation[^Covey] applied to teaching starts with instructing the students (dependence),  having them perform independently, and finally having them co-create.*

[^Covey]: Covey, Stephen (1989). *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*.

Developing individuals who can transform ideas into reality involves a delicate balance of nurturing and empowering, rather than merely instructing. By applying their skills, students grow both confident and competent. My goal is to create environments and opportunities for progressive learning, allowing students to exercise autonomy. “We grow through people and projects,” and these habits are best cultivated through practice, not lectures. Ultimately, my aim is to develop individuals to a point where they no longer need me and are fully equipped to make their own impact on the world. When I ask a complex, contextual exam question and receive meaningful answers, I know I have made a contribution towards a better society.

## Context

The challenge we face is that students enter our program with varying backgrounds and levels of experience. For instance, some students might have a strong foundation in computer programming from high school, while others may have only used email before starting university. Similarly, one student may own a virtual reality headset, whereas another might not even have a laptop.

This diversity necessitates a curriculum that is inclusive, engaging, and constructive, catering to a wide range of social and experiential backgrounds.

For students from less privileged backgrounds, the goal is to provide exposure to modern engineering tools and technologies, helping to level the playing field. For students with more resources, the emphasis is on understanding and communicating high-level concepts, regardless of the specific technology involved. This approach fosters a deeper grasp of core ideas and enhances their ability to convey complex concepts effectively.

I actively integrate discussions on societal trends, such as sustainable development goals, into the curriculum, highlighting how current technologies can address these issues locally.

As we strive to develop well-rounded, resilient, and impactful graduates, we adhere to the graduate attributes outlined by Stellenbosch University and the Engineering Council of South Africa. My approach includes using case studies to assess and promote these attributes, demonstrating the progress made and encouraging students to contribute positively to society.
