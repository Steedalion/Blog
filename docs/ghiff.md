# Supplying electricity to micro-informal settlements in Stellenbosch 

Micro-informal settlements are classified as a community that has arisen in an unsuspected area. 
Due to the small size and location of the community it is difficult for local municipalities to justift investment into infrastructure.
This leaves these communities without electricity. 
These communities often have modest needs, presenting an ideal opportunity for low cost off grid systems.

In this project we develop a solar PV system for micro-infromal settlement communities.

Through interviews with the community the behaviour is translated into functional requirements (lighting, USB charging of smartphones, and extensions for radio) and battery demand size. 
The devices will be installed within 6 homes in the community for a two week period, whereafter the members will be interviewed for the impact and suggested improvements to the device.

The system payback time is estimated to be 6 months replacing candles. Unforseen benefits include reduced danger of fires and asthma in children from removing candles.

Micro-informal settlements are often neglected due to their size, yet their modest needs make them ideal candidates for the migration to renewable energy. 
The authors hope that this work will prompt rethinking the challenges posed by sparse communities in the global south.
