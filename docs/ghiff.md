# Empowering Communities: Solar Solutions for Stellenboschâ€™s Micro-Settlements

Micro-informal settlements are communities that have emerged in unexpected areas. Due to their small size and location, it is difficult for local municipalities to justify investment in infrastructure, leaving these communities without electricity. However, their modest energy needs present an ideal opportunity for low-cost off-grid systems.

In this project, we developed a solar PV system specifically for micro-informal settlement communities.

Through interviews with the community, we translated their behavior into functional requirements, such as lighting, USB charging for smartphones, and extensions for radio, as well as battery demand size. The devices will be installed in six homes within the community for a two-week period, after which the residents will be interviewed to assess the impact and suggest improvements to the system.

The estimated payback time for the system is six months, replacing the use of candles. Unforeseen benefits include a reduced risk of fires and decreased asthma in children due to the elimination of candles.

Micro-informal settlements are often neglected due to their size, yet their modest needs make them ideal candidates for the transition to renewable energy. The authors hope this work will prompt a rethinking of the challenges posed by sparse communities in the global south.
