As researchers, being funded by taxpayers comes with a profound responsibility to ensure that our work generates the greatest social benefit. We achieve this in multiple ways:

1. **Teaching**: It is our duty to ensure that the students we graduate possess the skills and knowledge to contribute positively to society. In South Africa specifically, this extends to addressing the historical inequities by actively representing underrepresented groups and empowering the next generation to dream bigger and aim higher. Education is a critical tool in creating a more equitable society.
2. **Industry Collaboration**: The application of our academic skills in industry is paramount. By maintaining open communication and collaboration with industry, we align our research and teaching with the current and future needs of the economy. This keeps our work relevant and ensures that the insights from academia flow directly into practical, economic advancements.
3. **Forward-Looking Research**: Our research must not only address current problems but also anticipate future challenges. We have a responsibility to think ahead, tackling the problems of tomorrow through innovative and cutting-edge research. This proactive approach strengthens the foundation for sustainable development and progress.

## Research areas

### Virtual Prototyping of Manufacturing Assembly Systems

Manufacturing assembly is a major generator of economic wealth, and human operators remain a crucial component of manufacturing systems. While Industry 4.0 was techno-centric, Industry 5.0 brings with it a redefined value system that is human-centric, with an emphasis on making technologies practical and applicable.

In this line of research, we focus on applying bleeding-edge tools to create systems that support resilient manufacturing assembly, strengthening South Africa's atrophying manufacturing industry.

Through virtual prototyping, we can develop tools appropriate for small-scale manufacturing, enabling SMEs to respond quickly to market changes and exploit modern tools and technologies in ways that larger businesses cannot.

### Virtual Reality Engineering Training and Education

The demand for engineering training is scaling rapidly. Class sizes are increasing, and technology-driven disruptions will result in large-scale (re)training. Scaling engineering experience has become an urgent priority.

From an engineering education perspective, virtual reality makes it possible to provide industry-like experiences when physical site visits are impractical or unsafe, while still allowing visceral and practical (pre)experiences. Gamification has been shown to improve knowledge retention in both staff and students, but it requires significant development time. Disruptions such as the transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles mean that large numbers of maintenance employees will need retraining.

By developing virtual training and educational experiences, we can enable greater engagement with cutting-edge technologies that would otherwise be too expensive to experience at scale.

### The African Infrastructure Transition

Africa is characterized by a large rural population that is sparsely distributed. This situation demands a re-examination of common infrastructure assumptions. Aging and expensive infrastructure, designed for centralized and globally integrated cultures, is often poorly suited to African contexts.

The question here is simple: should we not consider African-centric solutions, thereby leapfrogging much of the proposed infrastructural change? A few examples come to mind. If you had the choice, would you not prefer to cook by fire?

This line of investigation examines solutions to current problems in ways that respect local cultures and the people affected by them.

My research ambitions can be divided into three key areas: **technical**, **capacity-building**, and **social**.

1. **Technical (Digital Twin)**
   My primary technical interest lies in the concept of the digital twin. Specifically, I am exploring how virtual tools can be used during the early and mid-stages of system design. The central question here is:

   > *How far can we progress in designing intelligent systems using virtual tools before we purchase physical equipment and commit to specific vendors?*

2. **Capacity-Building and Teaching (Undergraduate Research)**
   My focus here is on undergraduate research (UGR). Given the current academic context—larger classes, DHET funding tied to research outputs and publications, and a relatively young engineering faculty—UGR can be highly beneficial. I aim to implement UGR strategies that have proven successful elsewhere. The question I pose is:

   > *Should we not introduce research activities earlier in our academic careers?*

3. **Social (Just Energy Transition)**
   My social interest focuses on the just energy transition. While many benefit from the growing maturity of renewable energy technologies, certain groups remain excluded. In South Africa, for example, there are micro-communities with low populations, isolated locations, and limited economic resources. These factors often disincentivize infrastructure development. However, their modest needs and isolated nature could make them ideal beneficiaries of renewable energy. This raises the question:

   > *Should we not rethink African infrastructure given our sparsely populated continent?*

While responsible use of funds is a fundamental principle, I believe these specific interventions will enhance the societal impact of our work, making our contributions as researchers even more valuable to South Africa's economic and social progress.
