As researchers, being funded by taxpayers comes with a profound responsibility to ensure that our work generates the greatest social benefit. We achieve this in multiple ways:

1. **Teaching**: It is our duty to ensure that the students we graduate possess the skills and knowledge to contribute positively to society. In South Africa specifically, this extends to addressing the historical inequities by actively representing underrepresented groups and empowering the next generation to dream bigger and aim higher. Education is a critical tool in creating a more equitable society.
2. **Industry Collaboration**: The application of our academic skills in industry is paramount. By maintaining open communication and collaboration with industry, we align our research and teaching with the current and future needs of the economy. This keeps our work relevant and ensures that the insights from academia flow directly into practical, economic advancements.
3. **Forward-Looking Research**: Our research must not only address current problems but also anticipate future challenges. We have a responsibility to think ahead, tackling the problems of tomorrow through innovative and cutting-edge research. This proactive approach strengthens the foundation for sustainable development and progress.

### Exploring Specific Interventions:

1. **Supporting RSA Industry Growth**: A key focus should be on boosting the growth of South African industries. Encouraging the purchase and use of locally manufactured products is crucial. This fosters economic resilience, builds local capabilities, and reduces reliance on imported goods.
2. **Empowering Small Businesses**: Small businesses have the agility and flexibility to harness disruptive scientific and engineering innovations effectively. By supporting these enterprises, we can drive rapid implementation of new technologies, ultimately delivering greater value to customers and fostering a dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem.

While responsible use of funds is a fundamental principle, I believe these specific interventions will enhance the societal impact of our work, making our contributions as researchers even more valuable to South Africa's economic and social progress.
