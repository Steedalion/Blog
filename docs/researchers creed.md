As researchers, being funded by taxpayers comes with a profound responsibility to ensure that our work generates the greatest social benefit. We achieve this in multiple ways:

1. **Teaching**: It is our duty to ensure that the students we graduate possess the skills and knowledge to contribute positively to society. In South Africa specifically, this extends to addressing the historical inequities by actively representing underrepresented groups and empowering the next generation to dream bigger and aim higher. Education is a critical tool in creating a more equitable society.
2. **Industry Collaboration**: The application of our academic skills in industry is paramount. By maintaining open communication and collaboration with industry, we align our research and teaching with the current and future needs of the economy. This keeps our work relevant and ensures that the insights from academia flow directly into practical, economic advancements.
3. **Forward-Looking Research**: Our research must not only address current problems but also anticipate future challenges. We have a responsibility to think ahead, tackling the problems of tomorrow through innovative and cutting-edge research. This proactive approach strengthens the foundation for sustainable development and progress.

## Research areas

My research ambitions can be divided into three key areas: **technical**, **capacity-building**, and **social**.

1. **Technical (Digital Twin)**
   My primary technical interest lies in the concept of the digital twin. Specifically, I am exploring how virtual tools can be used during the early and mid-stages of system design. The central question here is:

   > *How far can we progress in designing intelligent systems using virtual tools before we purchase physical equipment and commit to specific vendors?*

2. **Capacity-Building and Teaching (Undergraduate Research)**
   My focus here is on undergraduate research (UGR). Given the current academic context—larger classes, DHET funding tied to research outputs and publications, and a relatively young engineering faculty—UGR can be highly beneficial. I aim to implement UGR strategies that have proven successful elsewhere. The question I pose is:

   > *Should we not introduce research activities earlier in our academic careers?*

3. **Social (Just Energy Transition)**
   My social interest focuses on the just energy transition. While many benefit from the growing maturity of renewable energy technologies, certain groups remain excluded. In South Africa, for example, there are micro-communities with low populations, isolated locations, and limited economic resources. These factors often disincentivize infrastructure development. However, their modest needs and isolated nature could make them ideal beneficiaries of renewable energy. This raises the question:

   > *Should we not rethink African infrastructure given our sparsely populated continent?*

While responsible use of funds is a fundamental principle, I believe these specific interventions will enhance the societal impact of our work, making our contributions as researchers even more valuable to South Africa's economic and social progress.
