Moder manufacturing systems include digital twin (Real<->SImulation) and Cyber-physical (Real<->intelligent) paradigms. Yet there is a clear gap regarding how to design these systems to encorporate humans.Head-mounted-display virutal realitys increased feasibility provides a rich new human-machine interface to facilitate human centric design through emersive simulation. Yet many system designers/developers are not experienced in using these technologies. Reference architectures and design patterns are systems engineering tools that has eased previous paradigm shifts by facilitating modularity, best practices, and common terminology. 

  This work describes a reference architecture for human assembly station development and continous improvement using virutal reality.

  The reference architecture is demonstrated through several case studies to be flexible and specifically address human centric challenges such as learning, validation, etc.

  The presented reference architecture contributes to "best practices" in design of these modern systems by extending emergin digital twin-design patterns, thereby facilitating a structured approach to developing solutions for human-operator manufacturing systems. Thins aligns with the industry 5.0 value of creating human-centric systems.
