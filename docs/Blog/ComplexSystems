## Why study systems?

# What are complex systems and why study them?
Systems have useful properties, my favourite being adaptivity. The term resilence is gaining a lot of steam as “the ability of a system to change its structure and function given unforseen changes”. This vague defition reminds me of how life regularly throws curve-balls and we are forced to adapt. While there are a slew of philiosophies I have gained from learning about systems what is the purpose of studying system?
Weinberg makes a compelling argument that the “systems we are able to observe survived, those that we can’t didn’t”. At some level, this suggests that by studying this class of systems, we are studying survivability. We observe measures of Darwinian evolution that work, those that do not are forever lost to time. Chaos systems that divide at Feigenbaum’s constant are chaotic, otherwise they would tend toward stability. While simple I think this answers Einsteins comment “the most incomprehensible thing about the universe, is that it is comprehensible”.
We only see what works (survives). This describes an observed law as a best practice. For example, we notice systems with higher diversity have higher resilience. An ecosystem with fewer variants of bugs, plants, and animals are more likely to be affected by a pathogen as it could remove a crucial pollinating bug that would result in a collapse. On the other hand, a system with more diversity would more likely encorporate the pathogen as some useful agent within the ecosystem. It therefore stands to reason then that more diverse economies are more resilent and numerous small businesses should be prioritized over consolidating vertical integration.
While the question of why to study systems may be difficult to define specifically, that may be a reductionist approach. My answer is simply complex, “we can learn what works”.
