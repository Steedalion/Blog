# Hierarchical vs Heterarchical networks

Two network structures are presented here. The Hierarchical network structure were devices are divided into levels, and higher levels aggregate lower levels. Aggregation refers to functioning together through coordinated control, data congregation. Hierarchy resembles SCADA systems.

Heterachical networks is structure typically adopted in IoT where nodes are created equally. The side effect is dynamic network topology in two ways. Firstly, we can scale by adding additional devices to the network. Secondly, we can more easily aggregate devices into specific services or holons. This gives heterarchical structures an added advantage in terms of flexibility and ease of scale.
