# Design science research methodology

Implementing human-centric systems are difficult to quantify. After all how human-centric is a solution? This complexity arises from the interaction of socio-technical problems. Human's are highly adaptive to their environment therefore changing technical aspects of the system may result in behavioural change which change the system altogether. For example, in South Africa scheduled power cuts were employed to reduce electricity demand, resulting in rapid adoption of renewable energy and battery packs[]. These new technologies resulted in higher surges when returning/cutting power, ultimately damaging equipment, further increasing power cuts, resulting in an unstable feedback loop. This resembles our earlier reference to the cost of industrial farming[].



For this reason, design science research methodology was used here. Arising from Information sciences, where behavioural-science paradigm develops and verifies theories to predict behaviour. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a domain are achieved by developing an artefact [[Design science in systems research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2017212.2017217)]. This approach acknowledges that we experience science through artifacts and the two cannot be separated. It vaguely resembles the methods of complex systems simulation white boxing models to investigate emergent behaviour [Stephan wolfram].

While different processes of the design-science exist [[6-step](https://doi.org/10.2753/MIS0742-1222240302),[Three-cycle](https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=sjis), [general-and-concrete-solution](https://doi.org/10.1057/ejis.2013.35), [FEDS](https://doi.org/10.1057/ejis.2014.36), [HENSOLT](https://doi.org/10.7166/30-4-2191)]. The 6-step process specifies six distinct processes. The three cycle process describes

These appear to be variants describing three distinct characteristics. Firstly, novelty/innovation without which process is simply design. 

Secondly,  relevance - identifying research requirements and acceptance criteria. Thirdly, rigor and improvement.

In our investigation we take a general systems approach where "a law must be demonstrated on atleast two independent systems" [Weinberg]. Therefore, we demonstrate our idea through two independent problems, in order to make more general statements about the developing human-centric assembly stations or systems in general.

1. We begin with relevance, identifying the needs of future systems based on literature. These include (1) investigations affecting the adoption and adaption of systems to human-centricity [Leitao], (2) economic agenda's describing future needs like in Industry 5.0 and EU-SGDs, and (3) perspectives interpreting these future needs [Lithui]. Synthesizing the requirements from literature leads to perspective on what human-centric solutions look like.

2. The problems selected are inspired by recent research and involve currently maturing technologies (deep learning and Additive manufacturing) in order to illustrate the novelty of this work. These insure a higher chance of novelty/uniqueness.  
3. We do not consider rigor or improvement. While we are convinced that using other algorithms will improve the performance of these systems it is outside the scope of this work. We do acknowledge the ability to improve performance through systematically separating components, prioritizing virtual design iteration, and .

This complexity suggests that systems are constantly developed and should be "easy to change", hence our di scussion on software engineering methods[].
