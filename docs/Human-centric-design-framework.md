# The need for human centric design frameworks in manufacturing

## The agenda of better metrics

We often forget that humans are at the core of every systems objective. We measure economic and sustainability metrics as proxies for how they will impact the lives of our selves, peers, and future generations. Movements like recycling, fair trade, and carbon neutrality can all be traced back to the preservation of our species.





Yet these proxies often distract us from the actual purpose. For example, in the 1960's Nobel Prize winner [Norman Borlaug](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1970/borlaug/facts/) developed "The Green Revolution" to greatly improve farming by utilizing a system of high yielding variety crops, monoculture practices, crop rotation, pesticide, new irrigation practices, and fossil fuel based fertilizer. This system displaced existing farmers and methods as the seed costs where higher, more mechanization was utilises, and more energy, water, and financial inputs were required. In the 1980's however productivity began to stall and backslide [[Consequence of Green Revolution in Asia](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.80.3270&rep=rep1&type=pdf)]. [The hidden cost of industrial farming](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/hidden-costs-industrial-agriculture) resulted in the depletion of topsoil, water pollution, low nutrient food, and loss of mid-sized farms, finally damaging downstream economies. This was later associated with the global obesity epidemic due to fewer crop varieties and lower nutrient soil [[Syndemic](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32822-8)]. This is but one of many examples of good intentioned systems being developed and implemented without considering the  long-term, complex, and multi-objective impact. 

In response, more homogeneous metrics include sustainability. For example the [United Nations 2030 Agenda](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s13398-014-0173-7.2) development goals balances economic, social, and environmental sustainability, later echoed by  the [African Union's 2063 Agenda](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=African+Union.+%282015%29.+Agenda+2063%3A+An+overview+of+Agenda+2063.+African+Union+Commission.). These frameworks emphasize a balance between economic, social, and  environmental sustainability, recognizing that success should not be  measured solely in terms of economic growth but should also consider the broader impact on society and the environment.

## Taylorism

Prior to automation, the clock was the best measure of performance, productivity, and efficiency. Taylor from the engineering school of management popularised the Time-and-motion study which led to significant increases in productivity. In this method a job is broken down into simple individual motions, measured with a stopwatch, and unnecessary motions are eliminated.

While this led to advances in productivity, this crude system models humans as machines and would be considered unethical today. On the other, hand this method lends itself well to automating via industrial robots. 

While some interpret industrial automation as displacing human operators, many in manfuacturing appreaciate that it elevated the role of human operators from a resource for completing mundane tasks, to one that is recognized and appreciated. Humans are now appreciated for their flexibility and adaptability. 

A simulatinous issue is that of the cost associated with human labor. 

 A naive comparison is to say machines can work tirelessly, while human operators have a limited number of productive hours in a day. Recent attempts to fully automate factories have failed [Tesla]. While manual assembly of  complex products is extremely challenging due the human error.

While the cost of labor in manufacturing has not changed significantly over the last 4 decades, the number of components in products have. With each subsequent task, human operators introduce a chance of a deffective assembly, requiring quality control methods. On the other hand machines make fewer errors leading to lower assembly yield loss.
