# The need for human centric design frameworks in manufacturing

We often forget that humans are at the core of every systems objective. We measure economic and sustainability metrics as proxies for how they will impact the lives of our selves, peers, and future generations. Movements like recycling, fair trade, and carbon neutrality can all be traced back to the preservation of our species.

Yet these proxies often distract us from the actual purpose. For example, in the 1960's Nobel Prize winner [Norman Borlaug](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1970/borlaug/facts/) developed "The Green Revolution" to greatly improve farming by utilizing a system of high yielding variety crops, monoculture practices, crop rotation, pesticide, new irrigation practices, and fossil fuel based fertilizer. In the 1980's however productivity began to stall and backslide [[Consequence of Green Revolution in Asia](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.80.3270&rep=rep1&type=pdf)]. [The hidden cost of industrial farming](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/hidden-costs-industrial-agriculture) resulted in the depletion of topsoil, water pollution, low nutrient food, and loss of mid-sized farms damaging downstream economies. This is but one of many examples of good intentioned systems being developed and implemented without considering the  long-term, complex, and multi-objective impact. In response, more homogeneous metrics include sustainability. For example the [United Nations 2030 Agenda](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s13398-014-0173-7.2) development goals balances economic, social, and environmental sustainability, later echoed by  the [African Unions](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=African+Union.+%282015%29.+Agenda+2063%3A+An+overview+of+Agenda+2063.+African+Union+Commission.). 

Similarly, early productivity gains in manufacturing can be attributed to the [Taylorism](https://www.britannica.com/science/Taylorism) time-and-motion system of breaking a job down to into individual motions, using a stopwatch to measure workers performance, and eliminating unnecessary motion.

A seminal study in nature found that the

For a while we have been distracted by the proxies themselves, but it appears recent events are again emphasizing.
