<p>braWhile data based applications for machines are becoming more prevalent, their human counterpart has lagged behind. This is largely due to challenges in measuring and modelling. </p>
<h1 id="measuring-challenges">Measuring challenges</h1>
<p>Humans are significantly more difficult to measure than their machine counterpart. Firstly because machines operate longer hours. We can easily have machine operator for 20 or more hour shifts were doing the same for a human is simply unethical. These longer operating hours mean we can gather more data from machines over longer windows of time. </p>
<p>The second challenge is the effect of measuring. While retro-fitting a machine with additional sensors presents no challenges, the same cannot be said for humans. Operators find measuring their state, performance, and activities invasive ... and rightly so. While this may seem like small issue that can be overcome with time higher levels of stress are associated with greater risk of injury and lower performance levels. This poses the direct problem that measuring adversely affects the performance of operators not revealing their true performance. In the case of wearable gloves and sensor based instrumentation and tools the cause is not psychological but physical. These gloves, tools, etc. directly interfere with the operators agency, comfort, task-familiarity, and ability to perform the given task. In the end the act of measuring human operators can inhibits their performance, leading to biased data.</p>
<p>The third issue of ethical use of data is of growing concern. In general there have been numerous scandals involving mega corporations like Google [], Facebook [], and Amazon [] regarding abuse of general users data. While the European has regulated the storage location and use of general user data, they have also begun looking at the ethical use of data in the workforce. Regulations inhibit the sharing of data between business entities and limiting the application of data for hiring based on performance. </p>
<p>It becomes clear that we cannot blindly apply the techniques used to measure machines to measuring humans. We need to be careful as the operator's impression is likely to affect the adoption of this technology. The public perception will also affect adoption and application as we must be careful to remember Systems Serve Humans [IEEE message], and Asimov's law of robotics must be adhered to not to raise the publics excitement to stories like terminator, the matrix, and iRobot.</p>
<h1 id="modelling-challenges">Modelling challenges</h1>
<p>Another, not totally independent issue, is the challenges of modelling human behaviour and performance. Humans are inherently complex to model and more complex models require more data, recursively indicating the feedback loop of challenges between human data and practical application.</p>
<p>The complexity of human models are cause by few characteristics best juxtaposed with their machine counterparts. Firstly, human models tend to be dynamic where machine models lend themselves better to steady state in general production. This becomes obvious when we compare a 12 Hour shift of industrial robot assembly with that of manual assembly. Human operators performance is likely to suffer from reduced throughput and increased errors. </p>
<p>Revealing the second issue, that human internal states, like learning and fatigue, are not directly measurable. This leads to estimation and observation of ill-defined quanitities that can only be reletavely defined. There is no absolute measure for fatigue and learning making models relevant only within a small domain.</p></div>
